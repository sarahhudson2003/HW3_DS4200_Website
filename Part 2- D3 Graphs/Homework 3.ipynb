    "## Part 1: Make your website (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will create a personal website using GitHub Pages. The website will introduce you or showcase something you’re passionate about—whether it's a hobby, academic interest, or a project. This assignment will help you become familiar with GitHub Pages, HTML, CSS, and how to deploy your website online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Website Structure (15 points): Your website must consist of at least two pages. You are free to structure the site based on the content you wish to highlight, but the following sections are required:\n",
    "    + Home Page (index.html) (5 points):\n",
    "        + A clear heading (e.g., \"Welcome to My Website\" or \"About Me\").\n",
    "        + A short introduction about yourself or the topic you are interested in. (At least 200 words)\n",
    "        + At least one image (e.g., your photo or something that represents your interests).\n",
    "    + A second page (or more) that expands on the details. This could include (5 points):\n",
    "        + Descriptive text explaining the content (At least 200 words)\n",
    "        + At least one image (e.g., your photo or something that represents your interests).\n",
    "        + A list (ordered or unordered) about the topic\n",
    "        + A heading smaller than the one on the Home Page\n",
    "    + Contact Information: Include a contact section (which could be on any of your pages) with links to your email or social media accounts.(2 points)\n",
    "    + Navigation: Your site should have clear navigation between pages, either via a header menu or links, so visitors can move seamlessly between the Home and Additional Page(s). (3 points)\n",
    "+ Styling & Customization (10 points): Style your website using custom CSS. You must implement three different customizations beyond basic styling. These could include:\n",
    "    + Custom fonts or typography.\n",
    "    + Color scheme changes for backgrounds, text, or links.\n",
    "    + Custom margins, padding, or layout adjustments.\n",
    "+ Deployment (5 points): Once your website is complete, ensure it is published on GitHub Pages. Double-check that all links and pages work properly before submitting. "

    "\n",
    "1. In the templete, we provide you a way to read the csv file. Once the data is read into d3. All the inputs are considered as strings. Therefore, the first thing we need to do is to convert the data to numeric type. The code is also provided.\n",
    "2. Setup the SVG canvas, scales and add the scales to the canvas and also add labels for the scales. (5 points) \n",
    "3. In order to make a boxplot, we need to calculate some basic metrics for the data. For each species, we need to calcualte the q1, median and q3. We first define a function called `rollupFunction` to list all the variables we need to calculate. Follow the example for q1 to setup for median and q3, or any other values you need. (5 points)\n",
    "4. Add comments for the following two lines (add in the .js file) to explain what those codes are doing. (5 points) \n",

    "        const boxWidth = xScale.bandwidth();\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "5. Inside the `.forEach` function, draw the boxes. There are three things you need to draw for the box plot: \n",
    "    - The vertical line in the middel from the q1-1.5 * IQR to q3+1.5 * IQR. However, in this particular question, since this range is quite large, you can just plot a line from the minimum value to the maximum value for each group.  (5 points)\n",
    "    - The rectangular shape from q1 to q3. You can add some color (the same color as the background) to hide the vertical line in the back.  (5 points)\n",
    "    - The horizental line for median (5 points)\n",
