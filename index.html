    <p class = "A">Hi! My name is Sarah Hudson, and this website is about my interest in singing and choral music. Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to learn choral and instrumental music and have always especially enjoyed singing. I had my first experience of being in a choir when I was seven years old, and I have continued to be in choirs throughout elementary school, middle school, high school, and now college. </p>
    <p class = "A">I joined the Northeastern University Choral Society (NUCS) during my first year at Northeastern and have participated in this ensemble every semester since then, with the exception of two spring semesters when I was on co-op.  </p>
    <p class = "A">NUCS is a mixed choir composed of between 70 and 100 Northeastern undergraduate and graduate students of all majors and fields of study. The choir rehearses on Tuesday evenings from 6:00 to 8:15 at the Fenway Center, located at 77 St Stephen St. in Boston, MA. Our repertoire includes music from a wide range of countries, time periods, and styles. In addition to concerts each semester, NUCS also performs at other functions including Northeastern’s graduation in Fenway Park and a tour to Carnegie Hall in New York City. For more information about the upcoming NUCS concerts this spring, please click the button above to navigate to a page with more details! </p>
