        <p class="text-between">NUCS will have two concerts for this year’s 2025 Spring Semester. The first performance will be on Friday April 11th at 7pm, and the second performance will be on Sunday April 13th, also at 7pm. Both concerts will be located in the Fenway Center. Tickets can be purchased on Northeastern’s eticketing website. For the general public, tickets cost $15 each, but Northeastern students can purchase them at a discounted rate for $5; there is also a giveaway for two tickets on NUCS’s social media platforms. Large bags are prohibited in the venue, and it is recommended to reserve tickets in advance. In addition to the NUCS chorus, the largest ensemble, the Chamber Choir and the Mosaic Treble Choir will also be performing at the concerts. The NUCS chorus will be performing four pieces at the concerts. The first three pieces are unique to this semester, while there is a tradition that the last piece, “The Road Home” is performed every spring semester. Prior to the beginning of this piece, graduating seniors in the ensemble are recognized. In addition, NUCS alumni who have returned to Northeastern to watch the concert are invited to join the choir onstage and sing as well. </p>
